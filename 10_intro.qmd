I hate when people take photos of every slide during the presentation.

You don't need to take photos of this deck, you can download it here.

I tried pushing this to GitHub pages, but the html file is more than 100 MB, so that broke

:::{.notes }
Motivation: The content mix was inspired by happy hour discussions after previous meetup groups. Some folks with substantial geospatial background didn't realize the insurance industry used geospatial data, so this will skew more toward domain knowledge than heavy-duty R coding, but you could certainly lift these concepts and throw down thousand of lines of R code to build out some cool territory models with the basics here.

We're going to start zoomed at at the entire Property & Casualty industry level, and then zoom into a single part of a homeowners rating plan
