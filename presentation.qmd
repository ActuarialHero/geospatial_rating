## U.S. Insurance Regulation

How this presentation is possible...

### Statutory Financial Filing Requirements
Insurance companies have to file financial statements quarterly and annual with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Ths includes details about premiums, losses, and expenses. This includes non-publicly traded companies.

### State Insurance Department Filings

Each state requirest insurance companies to tell them how their rating manuals.

Exact requirements vary from state-to-state and from line-to-line.

Lines of insurance sold to consumers such as Personal Auto, Homeowners/Renters, etc. tend to require much more detail and receive much more scrutiny.

States earn reputations...further comments about this will be address at the bar.
