## Statutory Financial Filing Requirements {background-color="#A1D6F4"}

::: {.incremental}

- Insurance companies in the U.S. have to file financial statements quarterly and annual with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)
- This is the underlying source for the data we've seen thus far
- The statements summarize premiums, losses, and expenses
- Unlike GAAP financials, which focus on companies as a going concern, these focus on the financial viability of the company
- Non-public companies have to submit this too
- You know how well your company is doing, even if it's not public!
- Typically called the "Yellow Book" for P&C Insurance Companies

If you're looking at potential employers, it's actually possible to see how well they're doing, even for non-publicly traded ones.

## Rate Filing Requirements {background-color="#A1D6F4"}

::: {.incremental}
- Insurance is regulated at the state level

- Many states, particularly in Home and Auto insurance, require carriers to file their rating algorithm with the state

- States vary in how detailed those filings are, how public the details are, and what variables are allowed in rating

- Some require approval before you can use them to price insurance

- Some have checklists specific to predictive modeling

- [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_regulatory_law#State-based_insurance_regulation) on state-based insurance regulation

- Summary: Think of this as having 51 separate external peer reviewers for anything you build

- **BUT**, you also get to see what goes into your competitor's pricing algorithms

Now the advantage of having to submit this information, is that a lot of it is public.

It's possible to see how your competitors calculate premiums. We can pull up one of the Allstate algorithms in Wisconsin.
