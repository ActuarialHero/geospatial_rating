# U.S. Insurance Regulation {background-color="#A1D6F4"}

::: {.notes}

Nothing excites an audience of open source statistical programming language aficionados as much as a talk about U.S. Insurance Regulation...
:::
## Statutory Financial Filing Requirements {background-color="#A1D6F4"}

::: {.incremental}
- Insurance companies in the U.S. have to file financial statements quarterly and annual with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)

- The statements summarize premiums, losses, and expenses

- Unlike GAAP financials, which focus on companies as a going concern, these focus on the financial viability of the company

- Non-public companies have to submit this too


- This is the underlying source for the data we've seen thus far

- Typically called the "Yellow Book" for P&C Insurance Companies

If you're looking at potential employers, it's actually possible to see how well they're doing, even for non-publicly traded ones.

## Rate Filing Requirements {background-color="#A1D6F4"}

::: {.incremental}
- Insurance is regulated at the state level

- Many states, particularly in Home and Auto insurance, require carriers to file their rating algorithm with the state

- States vary in how detailed those filings are, how public the details are, and what variables are allowed in rating

- Some require approval before you can use them to price insurance

- Some have predictive modeling checklists that must be completed

- Summary: Think of this as having 51 separate peer reviewers for any data engineering calculation or model you create
